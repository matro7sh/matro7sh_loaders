# Matro7sh loaders for Havoc

Are you incredibly lazy ? Are you super afraid of the terminal ? Do you want to impress your friends
with your payloads but cannot type `ls` in the terminal or read a README ?

Well fear not ! This plugin is for you ! Now, you can easily configure your shellcode and have them
loaded into _mostly okay_ golang loader. :)~

> Please note: some options are not available in the plugin because the API is a bit buggy...
